# CatalystCats

Run 'yarn' and 'yarn start' to load and run project.

App was tested on and developed for iOS. 

Since this is my first ever React-Native app, 
I don't have a big background of mobile engineering assumptions to speak to, 
but I will list some basic UI and SWE considerations below.

UI Assumptions:
- Primary use case: non-technical / non-professional use
- Audience: General public, but esp. crazy cat people : ]
- Task Hierarchy: Add Cat > Delete Cat >= Edit Cat
- Future Features: Filter/Sorting functionality => Image-based redesign (card-based UI?) => Image management functionality => use-case specific (pet health data, social sharing, etc.)

SWE Assumptions: 
- App would be run on current mobile operating systems
- Features and functionality were sufficiently general so as to be built using Expo and not React-Native CLI
-
